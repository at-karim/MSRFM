# Parts
Probably the most important folder on this GITHUB. It contains all the parts used in all projects. Adding to this library therefore must be done carfully. *Removing should never be done!*

### Overview

- Production: Contains parts that need manufacturing and can't be bought.
- Purchase: Contains parts that can be purchased and need no manufacturing.
