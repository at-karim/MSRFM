# Projects

Projects contains modules but also other assemblies. For example it contains the linear stage module, but also the assembly for the laserbox. 

### Overview

- Phase modulator:
- SRON:
- Linear stage: module that allows for linear translation of a 90 bent degree light path.
- Collimator Allignment Tool: Allignment tool with 6 DOF that allow complete control of your excitation path.
- Laserbox: A single container that houses all 6 powerfull lasers used in most of our experiments.
- Dichroic Adapter: A small tool that allows smaller dichroics to be mounted in larger dichroic mounts.
- Microscope tower: A single tower has the objective and stage mounted to it. With only a correctly alligned exication path, a correclty alligned emmision path is generated.
